# Using Webpack with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript (Deprecated)

**Deprecation Notice**: if you are planning on building a new application, we recommend using the [@arcgis/core](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) ES modules, here is a [sample application](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/esm-samples/webpack).

This [demo application](demo/) is the recommended way to build the [arcgis-js-api](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-js-api) using using Webpack and the [@arcgis/webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin).

You can read more about Webpack [here](https://webpack.js.org/).
