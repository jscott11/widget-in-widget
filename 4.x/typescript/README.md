# TypeScript

The [arcgis-js-api.d.ts](arcgis-js-api.d.ts) file provides type definitions for ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

A copy of this file is also available at [DefinitelyTyped][1] and may be installed using the command:  
`npm install --save @types/arcgis-js-api`

Currently, due to limitations in TypeScript, the APIs [autocasting](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/programming-patterns/#autocasting) functionality works best in non-TypeScript applications. No changes are required if you are already using the API without any TypeScript build errors.

## Requirements

* [TypeScript][2] 3.7+

## Resources

* [TypeScript Editor Support][3]
* Type definitions for many other libraries are available [here][4].
